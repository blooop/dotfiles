#   view.sh set      blocked, done, then idle -- never working    ("needs me")
#   view.sh clear    the Agents panel shows every agent           ("all")
#   view.sh toggle   flip between the two
#
# `keys.next_agent` is documented as "focus the next agent shown in the agent
# panel". It is *positional* -- one row from wherever you already are -- not
# priority-seeking. `ui.agent_panel_sort = "priority"` fixes the panel's ORDER,
# so row 1 is the most blocked, but F7 from row 5 still goes to row 6. That gap
# between "the queue is sorted" and "the key walks the queue" is the whole
# reason this plugin exists.
#
# It is made worse by `done` being defined as "idle and not yet seen": focusing
# the ticked agent marks it seen, it collapses to `idle`, and the panel re-sorts
# underneath you, so the *next* F7 lands somewhere unrelated.
#
# `agent.view.set` is the lever, because it "controls the expanded and collapsed
# sidebar, mobile Agents list, mouse targets, indexed focus, and next/previous
# Agent navigation" -- navigation included. Filter the panel to blocked+done and
# F7 cannot physically land on something that does not need you.
#
# There is no CLI for it, only the socket, which is why this is raw JSON rather
# than a `herdr` invocation like the rest of the plugin API.
#
# `idle` is in the filter too, sorted last. It was blocked+done only at first,
# which made the panel an inbox: `done` means "idle and not yet seen", so an
# agent that finished while its tab was focused went straight to `idle`, never
# entered the panel, and could not be found again by F7 once forgotten. With
# idle included and `attention desc` first, blocked and done still head the
# list -- prefix+alt+1 is still "most urgent", F7 from the top still walks the
# real queue -- and F7 then continues into idle agents, most recently changed
# first, instead of wrapping. The trade is that F7 can once again land on an
# agent that needs nothing; what it buys is never losing one.
#
# The cost, stated plainly: `working` agents leave the Agents panel while they
# work, and reappear the moment they finish or block. herdr has exactly one
# Agents panel and one projection on it, so there is no second sidebar showing
# everything -- the Spaces panel is that view at workspace granularity, F9 is
# the picker over all of them, and `toggle` (prefix+a) is the way to look at
# the full list for a moment and come back.
#
# The projection is transient and dies with the server, so `set` is also what
# the manifest's [[startup]] hook runs. State lives in a file because there is
# an `agent.view.set` and an `agent.view.clear` but no `agent.view.get`.
