# Name the Herdr tab after Claude Code's own session title, and stop the moment
# a human disagrees.
#
# Claude Code already writes a one-line summary of the session to the terminal
# title; Herdr captures it per pane as terminal_title_stripped (the raw one
# carries a spinner glyph). So this is a copy, not a generation step -- no model
# call, no token cost. All it adds is `herdr tab rename`.
#
# Three things it must never fight:
#
#   - A name you typed. Herdr's auto label is either "" or a bare integer (the
#     tab's position in the row), and nothing else ever is, so the integer test
#     alone is enough to claim an unnamed tab. Keeping it after that is what the
#     state file is for: we only overwrite a name we ourselves last wrote. Rename
#     a tab by hand and this goes quiet on it permanently -- and clearing the
#     name in the UI hands it back, because the label reads as auto again.
#
#   - devlaunch. Nothing to special-case: `dl` has no Herdr integration at all,
#     and inside a devcontainer there is no herdr binary and no HERDR_ENV, so the
#     guards below already no-op. Same guards keep it quiet outside Herdr.
#
#   - Another agent in the same tab. Two Claudes in a split would each write
#     their own title every turn and the tab would flicker between them, so a
#     multi-pane tab keeps its number.
#
# Installed as a Stop hook, so the name tracks the conversation as it drifts
# rather than freezing on whatever the first turn happened to be about. Set
# ONCE_ONLY=1 below for the freeze-on-first-turn behaviour instead.
